# Intro
Hey moose. Just some notes of things that will need some attention before even really getting started with this app.

## Bootstrap
* Using CDN to grab 4.6 (honestly not a fan of 5 - seems to have a lot of quirks)

## Font Awesome
* Going to need to get the app it's own font awesome CDN link (layout.html)

## Javascript
* revealFileName.js: this was a quick and dirty script ripped from so, going to need some work to get the path to display correctly
